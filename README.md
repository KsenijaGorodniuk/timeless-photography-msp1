## Description
____

This website was created for a fictional antique photo restoration business.
As this type of business is often small or even family-run, a customer is always at the very focus of every decision making.
With that in mind, we can assume that the budget for website development and maintenance may be restricted and that we need the website to be simple, small (only few pages long), but effective and attention-grabbing, so the the sparked interest encourages the customer to get in touch to find out more and allows the business owners to stand out from the competition without enduring high costs for website design and maintenance.

**Business Objectives:**

1. A simple to maintain and budget-friendly website
2. An additional outlet (on top of their social media accounts) for a visual representation of the quality service that the business offers
3. Widened customer target and reach
4. An opportunity for additional branding and credibility
5. Additional source of business

**Customer Objectives:**

1. A website that is easy to access, navigate and read
2. An opportunity to verify if the business is legitimate
3. An opportunity to check the quality of work produced by the business
4. An opporunity to compare the business with other businessesn on the market
5. An opportunity to get in touch with the business in just one click
6. A chance to find out more about the owners of the business and how long was the business operating

**Improvements to roll out in future:**

1. Add page with a detailed list of services and (estimated) price list
2. Add page about the team and businesses contributions towards local community (with images)
3. Section with links and icons for social media
5. Include a "behind-the-scenes" video
6. Offer online gift vouchers

## UX
____

Overall summary:

*(please remember that the business is fictional)*

Business owners decided to invest in a website that would be able to showcase their work and spark an interest in customer.

The main idea was to nurture the customer with an astetically pleasing website and encourage them to get in touch.

The website needed to be functional, simple, yet with corporation of quirky design elements. As the businesses operation is based on hand-on creativity, yet very tighly connected to vintage and antique timeline, it was important to show that the business is keeping up with the modern design trends, yet staying true to their main vintage theme.

### Who are our potential customers?

After inspecting their main customer profiles, the business confirmed that their main target audience is comprised of 45-65 age group of working professionals with children.

Restoring family heilrooms and memories is incredibly important to them. Not only to relive the happy moments from their childhood, or to gift their parents with a restored old wedding photograph, but to pass this small family heritage to their own children.

Being able to know that the business understands the emotional value behind the services that they provide and is able to produce quality work out of severely damaged or faded pictures is their number one priority. Helping the business to stand out from the competition, whist translating back to the customer the values mentioned above, was my own priority when completing this project.

### Strategy:

The strategy was developed in-line with businesses objections and it's target audience.

My mission was to produce a website, that can stand out from the competition, yet remain simple, easy to understand and be astetically appealing to different age groups.

It was important for the business to have a website that can demonstrate their work, values, professionalism and taste of style, without overloading the customer with information or visual elements. As the business is built on creativity and craftsmanship, it was important to communicate it back via website design to the customer.

### Scope:

The time frame, business goals and my own skills naturally dictated the the path of minimalist website that will be only few pages long and will be divided 50/50 between meeting business goals and customer objectives, without complicated colour schemes and with only few focus points per each section. 

The following principle (for website content p/section) was determined early on:

- visual + informative element (image + text) - option 1
- informative element only (text/form) - option 2
- visual element only (image) - option 3

### Structure:

This single-page website consists of the following sections and elements:

- Navigation menu (header section)
- Hero section with company's name
- About us section
- Gallery section
- Get in touch (footer) section

Although the website needed to look attractive and showcase the work of the business, it was important to keep the element structure simple and make sure that every element compliments another and the website's appearance is cohesive across all sections.

This was achieved by deciding early on the sections (above), not adding more elements than those that were included in the wireframe and sticking to the selected color theme and layout.

### Skeleton

Wireframes were designed with [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=CjwKCAiAnZCdBhBmEiwA8nDQxcDZTxYuzr8QiC1qlYXy0zf1p3vq2Yn6z83GXngt2bqR9ynoHBWulhoCiloQAvD_BwE)

A visual reference of the future website (to simplify the exact layout/color/font shoices) was designed in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/)

### Surface

**Design elements:**

*FONTS*
- The heading font first tested on Canva was not available in Google fonts, so an alternative font (Cormorant Garamond) was found on Google fonts and used.
- The rest of the text is in Arapey font from Google fonts
- To stand out and draw user's attention, some text sections were made bold, and some italicized

*COLOR PALETTE*

**#121210 black, #c24643 shade of pink-red, #333639 grey + white shades (#dfdfdf, #babfaa, #fff)**

The above colors comliment client's antique/vintage theme of restored photographs and stand out well on a page (high contrast levels).
#c24643 shade of pink-red was added to this palette to bring some quirkiness and freshness to this color mix and was used to make selected elements stand out on a page.

*IMAGES*

As this is a fictional business, I used antique and vintage images sourced from {Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).

*OVERALL STYLE*

Minimalist, modern, yet with an "old-school" and vintage aestetic.
A matching favicon was created with {Favicon.CC](https://www.favicon.cc/) for a more cohesive website look.
