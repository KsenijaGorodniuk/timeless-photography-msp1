## Description
____

This website was created for a fictional antique photo restoration business.
As this type of business is often small or even family-run, a customer is always at the very focus of every decision making.
With that in mind, we can assume that the budget for website development and maintenance may be restricted and that we need the website to be simple, small (only few pages long), but effective and attention-grabbing, so the the sparked interest encourages the customer to get in touch to find out more and allows the business owners to stand out from the competition without enduring high costs for website design and maintenance.

**Business Objectives:**

1. A simple to maintain and budget-friendly website
2. An additional outlet (on top of their social media accounts) for a visual representation of the quality service that the business offers
3. Widened customer target and reach
4. An opportunity for additional branding and credibility
5. Additional source of business

**Customer Objectives:**

1. A website that is easy to access, navigate and read
2. An opportunity to verify if the business is legitimate
3. An opportunity to check the quality of work produced by the business
4. An opporunity to compare the business with other businessesn on the market
5. An opportunity to get in touch with the business in just one click
6. A chance to find out more about the owners of the business and how long was the business operating

**Improvements to roll out in future:**

1. A page with a detailed list of services and (estimated) price list
2. A page about the owners and the team and businesses contributions towards local community
3. Link and import a preview of social media accounts
4. Include a "behind-the-scenes" video
5. Offer online gift vouchers

Overall summary:

(please remember that the business is fictional)

Business owners decided to invest in a website that would be able to showcase their work and spark an interest in customer.

The main idea was to nurture the customer with an astetically pleasing website and encourage them to get in touch.

The website needed to be functional, simple, yet with corporation of quirky design elements. As the businesses operation is based on hand-on creativity, yet very tighly connected to vintage and antique timeline, it was important to show that the business is keeping up with the modern design trends, yet staying true to their main vintage theme.

Who are our potential customers?

After inspecting their main customer profiles, the business confirmed that their main target audience is comprised of 45-65 age group of working professionals with children.
Restoring family heilrooms and memories is incredibly important to them. Not only to relive the happy moments from their childhood, or to gift their parents with a restored old wedding photograph, but to pass this small family heritage to their own children.
Being able to know that the business understands the emotional value behind the services that they provide and is able to produce quality work out of severely damaged or faded pictures is their number one priority. Helping the business to stand out from the competition, whist translating back to the customer the values mentioned above, was my own priority when completing this project.
